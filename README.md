# Cnn-for-devs
A project to teach Convolution Neural Network for devs

This project will walk through few important concepts to understand
how Convolution Neural Network works. 

I believe that the best way to learn something is through coding. In this project I will show how things work
using code.

Our journey will be:
- [Working with images and numpy](a-images-and-numpy.ipynb)
- [Image convolution with numpy](b-image-convolution.ipynb)
- [Building a neural network from scratch](b-vanilla-neural-network-from-scratch.ipynb)
- [Building a neural network with PyTorch](c-torch-neural-network.ipynb)
- [Convolution Neural Network with PyTorch](e-cnn-with-torch.ipynb)
- [Creating multitask models](i-multitask-model.ipynb)
- [CNN and autoencoding - image interpolation](f-image-interpolation.ipynb)
- [Image similarity - Image search](g-image-similarity.ipynb)
- [Generating images with GAN](h-generate-anime-with-GAN.ipynb)

CNN is an important part of computer vision. If you want to learn more about the topic you can check my 
related projects.
