# Cnn-for-devs
A project to teach Convolution Neural Network for devs

This project will walk through few important concepts to understand
how Convolution Neural Network works. 

I believe that the best way to learn something is through coding. In this project I will show how things work
using code.

CNN is an important part of computer vision. If you want to learn more about the topic you can check my other 
related projects.
