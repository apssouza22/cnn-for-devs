# Convolutional neural network(CNN) for devs

A project to teach Convolution Neural Network for devs

This project will help to teach some important concepts to understand how Convolution Neural Network works.

This project has one primary goal, to share insights and empower developers to leverage Deep learning applied to computer vision in their projects.

You can find more about the project [here](https://dev.to/apssouza22/convolution-neural-net-for-developers-free-course-5e95)

Our journey will be:

- [Working with images and numpy](a-images-and-numpy.ipynb)
- [Image convolution with numpy](b-image-convolution.ipynb)
- [Building a neural network from scratch](b-vanilla-neural-network-from-scratch.ipynb)
- [Building a neural network with PyTorch](c-torch-neural-network.ipynb)
- [Convolution Neural Network with PyTorch](e-cnn-with-torch.ipynb)
- [Creating multitask models](i-multitask-model.ipynb)
- [CNN and autoencoding - image interpolation](f-image-interpolation.ipynb)
- [Image similarity - Image search](g-image-similarity.ipynb)
- [Generating images with GAN](h-generate-anime-with-GAN.ipynb)

CNN is an important part of computer vision. If you want to learn more about this fascinating topic you can check my related projects.
