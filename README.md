# Cnn-for-devs
A project to teach Convolution Neural Network for devs

This project will walk through few important concepts to understand
how Convolution Neural Network works. 

I believe that the best way to learn something is through coding. In this project I will show how things work
using code.

CNN is an important part of computer vision. If you want to learn more about the topic you can check my 
related projects.
