    "**What is Backpropagation?**\n",
    "Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is a short form for \"backward propagation of errors.\" It is a standard method of training artificial neural networks. This method helps to calculate the gradient of a loss function with respects to all the weights in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation algorithm consists of two phases:\n",
    "- 1. The forward pass where we pass our inputs through the network to obtain our output classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  2. The backward pass (i.e., weight update phase) where we compute the gradient of the loss function and use this information to iteratively apply the chain rule to update the weights in our network.\n",
